# Openshift quickstart: Django

This is a [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com) project that you can use as the starting point to develop your own and deploy it on an [OpenShift](https://github.com/openshift/origin) cluster.

The master branch once hosted the oldest supported Django version (1.11) which is no longer supported. Now, this is just a signpost
for other branches with individual LTS Django versions.
